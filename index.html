        <br>life has originated and found habitability.
        <br>While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
        <br>Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice,
        <br>lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land,
        <br>consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates,
        <br>which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes</p></div>
